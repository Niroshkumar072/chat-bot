- The implementation is straightforward with a Feed Forward Neural net with 2 hidden layers.
- Customization for your own use case is super easy. Just modify `intents.json` with possible patterns and responses and re-run the training.

# Insatll Dependencies
```pip install pytorch```

```pip insatll nltk```


# Activation
```venv\Scripts\activate```

# Usage
Run
```python train.py```

chat
```python app.py```

# Modules
In this application we have modules like json file where our text and response is given and thes respones are taken into ```models.py``` file and using ```pytorch``` and ```nltk``` module we will dump by running ```train.py``` where the train.py file trains the model and data file and gives us data predection and losses  ```data.pth``` file and using that our app runs.
